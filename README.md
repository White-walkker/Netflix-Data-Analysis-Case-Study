## Dataset# Netflix Data Analysis Case Study

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of Netflix's content library. The analysis examines various aspects of Netflix's catalog, including the distribution of movies vs. TV shows, content growth trends, genre popularity, and production patterns across different countries.

## Project Objective
The main business problem addressed in this analysis is to generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which types of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow their business in different countries.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the "netflix_titles.csv" dataset, which contains information about 8,807 titles available on Netflix, including:
- Type (Movie/TV Show)
- Title
- Director
- Cast
- Country
- Date added
- Release year
- Rating
- Duration
- Listed genres
- Description

## Analysis Highlights
The analysis includes:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Statistical summaries of the Netflix content library
3. Univariate analysis (distribution of content types, content addition over time)
4. Bivariate analysis (duration distributions, genre correlations)
5. Missing value detection and treatment
6. Visualization of key trends and patterns

## Key Findings
- Netflix has significantly more movies (69.7%) than TV shows (30.3%) in its content library
- Content addition has been increasing substantially since 2013, with a stronger focus on movies
- International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies are the top genres on the platform
- Most TV shows on Netflix have only one season, indicating a preference for shorter series
- Country-specific content production patterns reveal opportunities for regional growth

## Recommendations
The analysis concludes with strategic recommendations for Netflix, including:
- Increasing focus on TV show production
- Approaching top directors for new content
- Diversifying genre offerings beyond International Movies
- Strategic content release timing around holidays and weekends
- Targeting countries with currently limited content availability

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to view the complete analysis
4. The PDF document provides the full case study with visualizations and insights

## Future Work
Potential extensions of this analysis could include:
